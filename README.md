# ModularMultipoints
This repository contains Sage code to compute normalized codomain models for elliptic curves which admit multiple ell isogenies from another elliptic curve.

Usage of the sage code requires the Kohel database https://repology.org/project/sage-data-kohel/versions. If you are unable to install the Kohel database you can use cocalc to run the program.
