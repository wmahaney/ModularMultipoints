# ModularMultipoints

This repo contains code for computing $\ell$-isogenies between elliptic curves from knowledge of their $j$-invariants, even when those j-invariants are connected by multiple distinct $\ell$-isogenies.

Based on "Computing Isogenies at Singular Points of the Modular Polynomial" by William E. Mahaney and Travis Morrison available at
